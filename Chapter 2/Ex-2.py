# Exercise 2: Variables
# Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author.
# Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks:
# Albert Einstein once said, â€œA person who never made a mistake never tried anything new."

# The \ before the quotations makes sure that it's part of the statement that needs printing and not the print command itself.
print("Christoph Waltz once said, \"The difference between Austrians and Germans is like the difference between a battleship and a waltz.\" ")
