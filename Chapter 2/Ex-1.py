# Exercise 1: Variables
# Assign a message to a variable, and print that message. 
# Then change the value of the variable to a new message, and print the new message.

_message = "To be or not to be."
print(_message)

# The variable _message is now assigned a different string, so the output is the new data.
_message = "That is the question."
print(_message)
