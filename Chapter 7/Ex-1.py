Chapter 7: Functions

# Exercise 1: Message
# Write a function called display_message() that prints one sentence telling everyone what you are learning about in this chapter. 
# Call the function, and make sure the message displays correctly.

# When writing procedures for functions, they can have specific tasks done for practically anything
# The programmer can code what happens inside them, this makes them user-defined
def display_message():
    print("We will learn about functions and how they can be user-defined and built-in the Python program.")
    
# By calling the function 'display_message' it will print the sentence as part of it's instruction
