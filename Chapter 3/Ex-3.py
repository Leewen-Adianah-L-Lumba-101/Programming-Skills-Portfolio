# Exercise 3: Your Own List
# Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. 
# Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

transportation = ["Yamaha", "Harley-Davidson", "Ducati", "Suzuki", "BMW"]

# The position of the names of the motorcycle brands are assigned a number
# You don't need to print the whole list to make statements about every brand
print("I don't want a", transportation[0], "motorcycle.")
print("Though, I would like to own a", transportation[1], "motorcycle.")
print("I don't really like", transportation[2], "motorcyles.")
print("Neither do I like a", transportation[3], "motorcycle.")
print("Nor do I want to own a", transportation[4],"motorcyle.")
