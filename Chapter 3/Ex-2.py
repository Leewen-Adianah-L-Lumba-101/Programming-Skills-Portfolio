# Exercise 2: Greetings
# Start with the list you used in Exercise 1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. 
# The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

names = ["Jasmin", "Blessings", "Mirabel", "Zuriel", "Daniela", "Seth", "Benedict", "Joaquin"]

# Using for loop to check every name then print the message for each name (alongside it)
for i in names:
    print("Salutations,", i + "!")
