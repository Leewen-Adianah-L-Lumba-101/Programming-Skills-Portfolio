# Exercise 4: Guest List 
# If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite?
# Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner.
# Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

dinnerparty = ["Henry VIII", "Niccolo Machiavelli", "Napoleon Bonaparte", "Joe Biden", "Thom Yorke"]

# Using a for loop again to invite each person on the list with their name
