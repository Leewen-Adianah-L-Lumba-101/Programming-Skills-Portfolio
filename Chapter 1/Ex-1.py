# Exercise 1: Print Strings
# Write a Python program to print the following string in a specific format.
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are! 
# Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky. 
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are

# The \n command makes statements print on the next line, the \t command only adds a space on the same line.
