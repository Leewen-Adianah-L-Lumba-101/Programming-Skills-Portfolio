# Exercise 4: Strings Concatination
# Write three strings in different variables and print the output as one string.

a = "Name"
b = "Age"
c = "Date"

# The + makes all the different strings of the variables print alongside each other without space.
# It's now one whole string.
print(a + b + c)
